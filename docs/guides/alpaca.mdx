<Note>

You will need an [Daedalus](https://daedalusfi.com) and [Alpaca](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup) account to get started.

## Alpaca Connection Guide

### Configure Trading Account

In Alpaca, you will see a dropdown option in the left menu allowing you to switch between a live trading account and a paper trading account.

Alpaca's Paper Trading allows you to test various trading strategies or integrations without using real money! Every Alpaca account comes with unlimited paper trading so you can get started without worrying about starting capital.

We recommend starting with a paper trading account to test your strategy ideas and later use your live trading account keys.

### Generate keys

You can then generate your keys on the homepage. Be sure to take note of your Key ID and Secret Key and save it somewhere private.

<Warning>

Once you navigate away from this page or refresh, your Secret Key will disappear. (You can always regenerate your keys. This will cause your old keys to no longer work, so be careful!)

</Warning>
