## Alpaca Connection Guide

1. Create an account on [https://daedalusfi.com](https://daedalusfi.com)

2. If you don't already have one follow create an Alpaca account
   [here](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup)

3. Once you've signed up for Alpaca, you will see a dropdown option in the left
   menu allowing you to switch between a live trading account and a paper
   trading account. Alpaca's Paper Trading allows you to test various trading
   strategies or integrations without using real money! Every Alpaca account
   comes with unlimited paper trading so you can get started without worrying
   about starting capital. We recommend starting with a paper trading account to
   test your strategy ideas and later use your live trading account keys.

4. You can then generate your keys on the homepage. Be sure to take note of your
   Key ID and Secret Key and save it somewhere private. Once you navigate away
   from this page or refresh, your Secret Key will disappear. (You can always
   regenerate your keys. This will cause your old keys to no longer work, so be
   careful!)
