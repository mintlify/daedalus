## Strategies overview

Strategies are automated trading instructions that you can build and customize with Daedalus.

If you don't have any strategies, you can create them by visiting the [Daedalus platform](https://app.daedalusfi.com).

### Enabling strategies

While you can't create or edit strategies on the mobile app yet, you can turn them on and off on the fly.

To turn a strategy on or off, navigate to the `My Strategies` tab of any portfolio or brokerage account from the home page. There, you can view different strategies available between `Mine`, `Invested In`, and `Templates`.

Navigate to a particular option, and simply click on the toggle to turn a strategy on or off.
